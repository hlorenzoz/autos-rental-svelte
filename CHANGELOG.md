# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Lighthouse CI configuration (`.lighthouseci/lighthouserc.json`) wiring the `bun run lighthouse` script: collects the home, inventory and localized inventory routes via the preview server and asserts Performance ≥ 0.90 and Accessibility ≥ 0.95.
- "Vehicle Delivery" service on the landing services section (replacing the former sales service), with `en`/`es` copy.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- **Rebranded** the site from "AeroDrive" to **Vicron Lopez** across navigation, footer, hero, copy, legal text, testimonials, meta tags and contact emails (`info@vicronlopez.es`).
- **Converted the platform to rental-only.** All vehicles are now rentals priced per day; the catalog, hero search, vehicle cards and detail page present a single rental flow.
- Simplified the vehicle data model: removed the `type` (`sale`/`rent`/`both`) field and the nested `price` object in favor of a single required `pricePerDay` number (`src/lib/schemas/vehicle.ts`, `src/lib/data/vehicles.json`).
- Collapsed the vehicle browsing experience into a single `/vehicles` (`/es/vehiculos`) inventory; removed the buy/rent mode toggle from the hero and inventory hub.
- Updated base URL / canonical / prerender origin to `https://vicronlopez.es` and `PUBLIC_SITE_NAME` default to `Vicron Lopez`.

### Removed

- Vehicle sales feature in its entirety: the `/vehicles/for-sell` and `/vehicles/for-rent` routes (and their `/es/en-venta`, `/es/en-alquiler` localized paths), the "Vehicle Sales" service, sale pricing/badges/CTAs, and all sale-related i18n keys.
- Orphaned `VehicleFilterPanel` component and the `getVehiclesByType` / `getVehiclePriceInfo` data helpers.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-29

Initial foundation of the SvelteKit premium website.

### Added

- SvelteKit 5 application scaffold on Bun, deployed via `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel`.
- Bilingual i18n (English / Spanish) with fully localized URLs and transparent path rewrites through a reroute hook.
- Vehicle catalog with listing, filtering, search and individual detail pages (originally supporting sale, rent and dual-type vehicles).
- Glassmorphism design system (Tailwind CSS v4) with light/dark theming, CSS-variable tokens and flash prevention.
- Landing page sections: hero with live search, overview, featured vehicles, services, reviews and contact.
- Contact form with Zod-validated schema.
- Legal pages (privacy, terms, cookies) and a human-facing sitemap page.
- Dynamic localized `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` endpoints.
- Zod-validated environment variables.
- Vitest unit/integration test suite with coverage and Playwright E2E configuration.
- Sentry error monitoring and PWA strategy (manifest, service worker, offline support).
